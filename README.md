Japanese syllabary in JSON format
=================================

There are a few Transformation functions that you can use in transform.js.  You can also use them as an example on 
how to generate files that might be more useful to you.

This is obviously a work in progress:  
 
 - Verifying Kunrei-shiki romanization (ISO 3602) for r≈çmaji interpretations of the characters.
 - Yoon (compound characters) are coming soon.
 - Looking at possibly organizing things in different schemas for easier uses.
 - My goal is to add modern Kanji as well, although obviously this will take a longer time.
 

Please contact me if you have suggestions, ideas or any questions.
